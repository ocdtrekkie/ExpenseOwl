# Why Create This?

There are a ton of amazing projects for expense tracking across GitHub ([Actual](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual), [Firefly III](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii), etc.). They're all incredible, but they aren't the *fastest* when trying to add expenses and offer many features I don't use. Some use varying formats of data or complex APIs. *Don't get me wrong*, they're great when needed, but I wanted something dead simple that only gives me a monthly pie chart and a tabular representation. NOTHING else!

Hence, I created this project, which I use in my home lab to track my expenses. The data is just JSON, so I can do whatever I want with it, including using `jq` to convert to CSV. The UI is elegant and mobile-friendly.

This app's intention is to track spending across your categories in a simplistic manner. There is no complicated searching or editing - just add, delete, and view! This intention will not change throughout the project's lifecycle. This is not an app for budgeting; it's for tracking.

# Features

### Core Functionality

- Simple expense tracking with essential details only (optional name, date without time, amount, and category)
- UUID-based expense identification in the backend
- Flat file storage system (`data/expenses.json`)
- Multi-architecture Docker container with support for persistent storage
- REST API for expense management
- Single-user focused (mainly for a home lab deployment)
- CSV export of all expense data from the UI
- CLI for both server and client (if needed) operations
- Custom categories via environment variable (`EXPENSE_CATEGORIES`) with sensible defaults
- Custom currency symbol in the frontend via environment variable (`CURRENCY`)

### Visualization

1. Dashboard with expense category breakdown (pie chart)
    - Click on a category to exclude it from the graph, click again to add it back
    - This helps visualize the breakdown without considering some categories like Rent
    - The legend shows the total expenditure of the month along with the total without the "Rent" category
2. Table view for detailed expense listing
    - This is where you can view individual expenses chronologically and delete them
    - You can use the browser's search to find a name if needed
3. Month-by-month navigation

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

The front end of ExpenseOwl can be installed as a Progressive Web App on desktop and mobile devices (i.e., the back end still needs to be self-hosted). To install:

- Desktop: Click the install icon in your browser's address bar
- iOS: Use Safari's "Add to Home Screen" option in the share menu
- Android: Use Chrome's "Install" option in the menu

### Intention of Use

I reiterate that you should use this to add expenses quickly. The default name for an expense is `unnamed`, and the date is automatically set to today. There's a default list of categories, which can be edited easily through an environment variable.

In the ideal case, `enter the amount and choose the category` - that's it!

For a bit more involved case, `enter the amount and name, choose the category, and select the date` - still very simple!

The application only allows addition and deletion; there's no need for editing. There are no tags, wallet info, budgeting, or anything else! Plain and simple for the win.

# Installation

### Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/tanq16/expenseowl/cmd/expenseowl@latest
```

### Docker Installation

```bash
docker pull tanq16/expenseowl:main
```

```bash
docker run -d \
--name expenseowl \
-p 8080:8080 \
-e EXPENSE_CATEGORIES="Rent,Food,Transport,Fun,Bills" \
-e CURRENCY=jpy \
-v expenseowl_data:/app/data \
tanq16/expenseowl:main # EXPENSE_CATEGORIES, CURRENCY are optional configs
```

To use it with Docker compose or a container-management system like Portainer or Dockge, use this YAML definition:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  budgetlord:
    image: tanq16/expenseowl:main
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 5006:8080
    volumes:
      - /home/tanq/expenseowl:/app/data # CHANGE DIR
```

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanq16/expenseowl.git && \
cd expenseowl
```

```bash
go build ./cmd/expenseowl
```

# Usage

Ideally, once deployed, use the web interface and you're good to go. Access the web interface through your browser:

- Dashboard: `http://localhost:8080/`
- Table View: `http://localhost:8080/table`

> [!NOTE]
> This app has no authentication, so deploy carefully. It works very well with a reverse proxy like Nginx Proxy Manager and is mainly intended for home lab use. The app has not undergone a pentest to allow for any production deployment. It should strictly be deployed in home lab settings, behind authentication, and for only one (or a few non-destructive) user(s).

If command-line automations are required for use with the REST API, read on!

### CLI Mode

The application binary can run in either server or client mode:

Server Mode (Default):

```bash
./expenseowl
# or explicitly
./expenseowl -serve
# or from a custom directory
./expenseowl -data /custom/path
```

Client Mode:

```bash
./expenseowl -client -addr localhost:8080
```

In client mode, you'll be prompted to enter the expense name, category (select from a list), amount, and date (in YYYY-MM-DD; optional, sets to the current date when not provided).

### REST API

Add Expense:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/expense \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
 "name": "Groceries",
 "category": "Food",
 "amount": 75.50,
 "date": "2024-03-15T14:30:00Z"
}'
```

Get All Expenses:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/expenses
```

### Config Options

##### Currency Settings

ExpenseOwl supports multiple currencies through the CURRENCY environment variable. If not specified, it defaults to USD ($). For example, to run with Euro, use the following environment variable:

```bash
CURRENCY=eur ./expenseowl
```

Similarly, the environment variable can be set in a compose stack or using `-e` in the command line with a Docker command. The full list of supported currencies is in [this file](https://github.com/Tanq16/ExpenseOwl/blob/main/internal/config/config.go#L27).

##### Category Settings

ExpenseOwl also supports custom categories, which can be specified through environment variables like so:

```bash
EXPENSE_CATEGORIES="Rent,Food,Transport,Fun,Bills" ./expenseowl
```

Similarly, it can be specified in a Docker compose stack of a Docker CLI command with the `-e` flag. Refer to the examples shown above in the README.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome; please ensure they align with the project's philosophy of simplicity. The project's core principle is maintaining user-facing simplicity by strictly using the current [tech stack](#technology-stack). It is intended for home lab use, i.e., a self-hosted first approach (containerized use). Consider the following:

- Additions should have sensible defaults without breaking foundations
- Environment variables should be used for user configuration in containers
- Custom features should prefer configuration via command-line arguments
- Found a typo? Please open an issue instead of a PR

Ideas and improvements are welcome! Feel free to start a discussion by opening an issue.

# Technology Stack

- Backend: Go
- Storage: JSON file system
- Frontend: Chart.js and vanilla web stack (HTML, JS, CSS)
- Interface: CLI + Web UI
